# Instructions

With the help of this course, you will do the incredibly simple things that all programmers need to do to learn a language:

1. Go through each exercise.
2. Type in each sample exactly.
3. Make it run.

This may be _very_ difficult at first, but please stick with it.

___

## Reading and Writing
It seems stupidly obvious, but, if you have a problem typing, you will have a problem learning to code. Especially if you have a problem typing the fairly odd characters in source code. Without this simple skill you will be unable to learn even the most basic things about how software works.

Typing the code samples and getting them to run will help you learn the names of the symbols, get familiar with typing them, and get you reading the language.


___
## Do Not Copy-Paste
You must type each of these exercises in, manually. If you copy and paste, you might as well just not even do them. The point of these exercises is to train your hands, your brain, and your mind in how to read, write, and see code. If you copy-paste, you are cheating yourself out of the effectiveness of the lessons.
